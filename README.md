# 52-card-problem-
Assuming there is a deck of 52 cards, 26 are odd numbers and 26 are even numbers. 
The dealer places the deck faced down and reveals the top card one at a time. 
Before he reveals each card, he asks the player to guess whether the next card will be an odd or even number. 
If the player guesses correctly, he gets +1 point. If he guesses wrongly, he gets -1 point. 
The player starts with 0 points. Assuming the player is competent and rational, his best strategy is to "card-count". 
Based on the number of odd and even cards revealed beforehand, he will know whether there are more odd or even cards left in the deck. 
He will subsequently guess the option that is more likely. 
This code aims to find the expected value of the player's points given that he plays the above-mentioned strategy.
